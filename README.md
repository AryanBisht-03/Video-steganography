# Video-steganography

This my final year project. If you want, you can it and modifiy it. 
In this project a message is first encrypted using SHA256 and AES256, then encoded in the video.
You need to run the python script on both sender and reciever to encode and decode the message.
I have used LSB algorithm in this.

I am also uploading documentation(report) with latex zip and presentation for this project. If you want can edit it easily in overleaf.
Thank me later.!!!
